# Python Notebooks

This repository contains various Python notebooks organized into different directories based on their purpose and complexity.

## Directories

- `python_basics/`: Contains notebooks and scripts that cover the basics of Python programming.
- `small_projects/`: Contains small projects to practice and demonstrate Python skills.
- `medium_projects/`: Contains medium-sized projects to further enhance Python skills.
- `data_engineering/`: Contains projects and scripts related to data engineering.
- `machine_learning/`: Contains projects and scripts related to machine learning.

Each directory has a README file and a Python notebook with a basic example to get started.
